👋 Hi, I’m Ankit Patil, a Computer Science professional based in Binghamton, NY, with a Master's in Computer Science from Binghamton University. I combine strong academic knowledge with hands-on experience.

💻 I’m skilled in several programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, and Rust, and have experience with frameworks such as ASP.NET and Flask. My toolkit also includes tools like Jira, Visual Studio, GitHub, SQL, MongoDB, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

🌟 At SafeSpace, I’ve been working on a mental health app similar to social media platforms, developing new features that boosted daily active users by 15%. I optimized a database of over 10,000 mental health professionals, which improved the app’s recommendations by 30% and made it easier for users to find nearby resources. Collaborating with a cross-functional team, we increased user engagement by 20% by enhancing content feeds and chat functionality.

🛠️ Before SafeSpace, I worked as a Software Engineer at Raj Infrastructure, where I developed human-machine interface components for SCADA systems and created custom solutions for Building Information Modeling (BIM). This contributed to improved user engagement and successful project outcomes.

🔍 My background in Computer Science includes areas like Operating Systems, Systems Programming, Algorithms, Cloud Computing, and Computer Security. I enjoy solving complex problems and delivering innovative solutions.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating with others in the tech space. Feel free to connect or reach out via LinkedIn or email (apatil@binghamton.edu) for discussions, opportunities, or just to chat!

Skills- Python, JavaScript, C, C++, Java, Rust, ReactJS, Flask, Django, RESTful APIs, Docker, Kubernetes, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GitHub, Visual Studio
